# find-skills

## What it is

A utility skill that teaches the agent how to discover, vet, and install capabilities from the open [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) ecosystem using the Skills CLI (`npx skills`). It emphasizes quality signals (install counts, source reputation) before recommending anything.

## When to use it

Use when you want the agent to:

- Search for an existing skill instead of improvising a large workflow from scratch
- Explain how to install or update skills globally or per project
- Compare options from the leaderboard or `npx skills find`

**When not to use it:** When the task is clearly one-off, repo-specific, or already covered by a skill you have installed. When the user explicitly wants custom instructions only, not ecosystem packages.

## What the agent will do

Follow a structured flow: infer domain and task, check the public leaderboard, run targeted CLI searches, verify quality, then present install commands and links. See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the full procedure and example responses.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and network access for `npx skills`
- Optional: familiarity with [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) for browsing

## How to install

From this repository (adjust URL if you use a fork):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/mappa-ai/skills --skill utils-skills/find-skills
```
